1- Install the plugin
2- Enable web service advance feature (Admin > Advanced features)
3- Enable REST and XMLRPC protocol (Admin > Plugins > Web services > Manage protocols)
4- Create a token for a specific user and for the service 'webhookhelper' (Admin > Plugins > Web services > Manage tokens).
5- Enable specific external services. We need 'webhookhelper' to be enabled and 'Moodle Mobile Web Service' is useful for debugging the client.

Development Example:
1- Download the client: https://github.com/EvanDaley/node_client
2- Configure the node client with the correct credentials and validate that the plugin is accessible
